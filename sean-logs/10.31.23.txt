Continued Working on Modding Documentation

Had meeting with Erik and Alice about updates and discussing Github

Fixed native rollback as deleting files and readding them for screenshot purposes created linker errors which fixing steps were added to the mod creation tutorial

Alice worked with me to create better testing methods, she was able to output debug.txt outputs into the log file and I implemented my counter into the code
- Steps for this will also be added to the tutorial
