Weekly meeting with Erik and Anthony - 1 - 2pm
- Anthony found that the native testing errors arose with LNK2019 which is caused by the native files not being linked to the project
- To fix this 
  - Go the File > Move "native_file.cpp/.h" > Minetest
  
Continued working on native testing - 2pm - 4pm
- Linker error removed but now having issue with creating new functions and calling them within the mods folder.
- Came to this conclusion by rewriting l_remove and calling it l_native_remove and not calling n_remove within the function but copying l_remove
- Prints nil responce when called even though it is the same function with a different name

Create documentation - 11 - 12am
